# 20-Questions
The QuestionsMain allows you to play a game of 20 questions using the QuestionsGame class. The program is not limited to 20 questions, but will ask you a series of yes or no questions until it is ready to make a guess. If it guesses wrong, the user is prompted to provide a yes or no question that would have led it to the right answer as well as what the answer is. It then inserts the question and answer in the file and "learns" so it doesn't make that mistake again.

To test the QuestionsGame class, download the all three files, and run the QuestionMain.java file in an appropriate IDE while both java files are in the same folder. Next, run the file, and when prompted to read from a previous tree, type in y so it can read from the spec-questions.txt file, otherwise the computer will start off from scratch. After you've thought of an object to guess, simply respond to the yes or no questions with y or n until the program makes a guess.

(NOTE: QuestionMain.java and spec-questions.txt files were not created by me and are simply provided as tools for you to test my program.)
